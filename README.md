## Image Optimization

To ensure fast loading, optimize images in the `public` folder using the provided script:

1. Install dependencies (if not already):
   ```bash
   npm install sharp
   ```
2. Run the optimization script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/optimize-images.js
   ```
This will resize and compress all key images in the `public` directory. Re-run the script whenever you add or update images.
